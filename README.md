### Decentralized currency exchange platform
MVP phase

A goal is to provide simulation of currency exchange without central bank. All exchanges are generated by users

MVP has very limited feature set that includes
- Auth(Login/Create) 
- Create new wallet
- Add a currency to wallet
- Create buy order
- Create sell order
- Buy currency
- Sell currency

Does not include
- Log out
- Web UI interface
- CORS token
- Docker containers and docker compose

These is two ways to use app
- You need to clone this git repo, navigate to root and run 

``cargo run --bin authserver``

``cargo run --bin bidder``

``cargo run --bin user``

``cargo run --bin client``

If you run in this way you will see a list of CLI commands that are available to the user

Another way is to run Swagger UI. It provides better user interface

``cargo run --bin authserver``

``cargo run --bin bidder``

``cargo run --bin user``

``cargo run --bin swagger``
